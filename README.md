**Privacy Policy**

Last Modified: August 8, 2024

Your data privacy is of utmost importance to us. This policy details: the data we accumulate and the reasons behind it; the manner in which your data is managed; and the privileges you possess regarding your data.

This policy is applicable to all products developed and maintained by Nexforce Global Corp., including Nexbot by Nexforce.

**What we gather and the reasons behind it**

Our fundamental rule is to gather only what is necessary. Here's how this is realized in practice:

**Identification & Accessibility**

Upon registering for a product of Nexbot by Nexforce, we request identification details like your name, email address, and perhaps a company name. This enables you to customize your new account, and allows us to send you product news and vital updates. Periodically, we might send optional surveys to better understand your usage of our products and enhance them. With your approval, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. Occasionally, we offer the opportunity to add a profile image that appears in our products.

We will never market your personal information to third parties.

**Billing Details**

In case you register for a paid product of Nexbot by Nexforce, you will be asked to provide your payment details and billing address. Credit card information is directly submitted to our payment processor and never touches Nexforce servers. We keep a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address for charging you for service, calculating any sales tax due, sending invoices, and detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. We sporadically use aggregate billing information to direct our marketing efforts.

**Product interactions**

Information that you upload, receive, or maintain in your Nexbot by Nexforce accounts is stored on our servers to ensure you can utilize our products effectively. This content is preserved as long as your account remains active. Upon the deletion of your account, we maintain the right to remove this content.

**Geolocation data**

In order to mitigate future spammy signups, we record the full IP address used during the creation of a product account across the majority of our offerings. We also keep a log of all account access with full IP addresses for security and fraud prevention. This login data is retained for the duration of your product account's lifespan.

**Website interactions**

To assist with analytics and statistics, such as testing conversion rates and experimenting with fresh product designs, we gather information about your browsing behavior. This data includes details like your IP address, browser and operating system versions, the web pages you visited and their loading times, and the site that directed you to us. For active accounts, these web analytics are linked to your IP address and user account. The Advertising and Cookies section below provides further details about the web analytics we employ.

**Advertising and Cookies**

Nexforce Global Corp operates contextual advertisements on various third-party platforms, such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Users who engage with our advertisements are redirected to the Nexforce marketing site. In regions where it is legal, we may use a script from the ad company that sets a third-party cookie and shares data with the ad network. This information assists in evaluating the efficacy of our ads, e.g., which ad was clicked, the keyword that triggered the ad, and whether the user performed certain actions such as clicking a button or filling out a form.

We also employ persistent first-party cookies and certain third-party cookies to store preferences, simplify the use of our applications, facilitate A/B testing, and support analytics.

A cookie is a piece of text that your browser saves. Cookies help remember login details and site preferences. They may also gather information such as your browser type, operating systemrvice into your use of our products.

Data transmitted through Nexbot by Nexforce to HubSpot will be stored by both Nexforce Global Corp and HubSpot.
Nexforce Global Corp employees may assume your Nexbot by Nexforce account to deliver system diagnostics or assistance to you. For example, if a bug arises that we identify and need to understand in your account, we will only access your account data with your explicit permission and to the extent necessary. We'll also inform you when this happens.
We reserve the right to disclose your data to law enforcement, regulatory bodies, or legal counsel in compliance with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, court order, legal process, or governmental request. In such circumstances, we will only share your data to the extent required and we will notify you unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.

We retain your personal data as long as your account remains active and as necessary to provide you with our services. After you close your account, we might still retain some of your information for legal, security, and business reasons, such as to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, and fulfill our terms of service.
