Copiloty chrome extension privacy policy.

Last Modified: June 26, 2023
Your data privacy is of utmost importance to us. This policy details: the data we accumulate and the reasons behind it; the manner in which your data is managed; and the privileges you possess regarding your data.
This policy is applicable to all products developed and maintained by Nexforce Global Corp., including Copiloty by Nexforce.
What we gather and the reasons behind it
Our fundamental rule is to gather only what is necessary. Here's how this is realized in practice:
Identification & Accessibility
Upon registering for a product of Copiloty by Nexforce, we request identification details like your name, email address, and perhaps a company name. This enables you to customize your new account, and allows us to send you product news and vital updates. Periodically, we might send optional surveys to better understand your usage of our products and enhance them. With your approval, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. Occasionally, we offer the opportunity to add a profile image that appears in our products.
We will never market your personal information to third parties.
Billing Details
In case you register for a paid product of Copiloty by Nexforce, you will be asked to provide your payment details and billing address. Credit card information is directly submitted to our payment processor and never touches Nexforce servers. We keep a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address for charging you for service, calculating any sales tax due, sending invoices, and detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. We sporadically use aggregate billing information to direct our marketing efforts.
Product interactions
Information that you upload, receive, or maintain in your Copiloty by Nexforce accounts is stored on our servers to ensure you can utilize our products effectively. This content is preserved as long as your account remains active. Upon the deletion of your account, we maintain the right to remove this content.
Geolocation data
In order to mitigate future spammy signups, we record the full IP address used during the creation of a product account across the majority of our offerings. We also keep a log of all account access with full IP addresses for security and fraud prevention. This login data is retained for the duration of your product account's lifespan.
Website interactions
To assist with analytics and statistics, such as testing conversion rates and experimenting with fresh product designs, we gather information about your browsing behavior. This data includes details like your IP address, browser and operating system versions, the web pages you visited and their loading times, and the site that directed you to us. For active accounts, these web analytics are linked to your IP address and user account. The Advertising and Cookies section below provides further details about the web analytics we employ.
Advertising and Cookies
Nexforce Global Corp operates contextual advertisements on various third-party platforms, such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Users who engage with our advertisements are redirected to the Nexforce marketing site. In regions where it is legal, we may use a script from the ad company that sets a third-party cookie and shares data with the ad network. This information assists in evaluating the efficacy of our ads, e.g., which ad was clicked, the keyword that triggered the ad, and whether the user performed certain actions such as clicking a button or filling out a form.
We also employ persistent first-party cookies and certain third-party cookies to store preferences, simplify the use of our applications, facilitate A/B testing, and support analytics.
A cookie is a piece of text that your browser saves. Cookies help remember login details and site preferences. They may also gather information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, length of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. While you can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, disabling cookies may impair our applications' functionality and other aspects of our service.
Voluntary correspondence
When you reach out to Nexforce Global Corp with a query or for assistance, we retain that correspondence, including your email address, to keep a history of our past interactions for future reference.
We also store information you might volunteer, such as written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we might ask your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. However, we will only do so with your explicit consent.
Approach to Chrome Extension permissions
Some of our products offer Chrome extension applications. Due to the design of these platforms, our apps often need to request your consent before accessing privacy-sensitive features of your device. This consent is always optional, and our apps will function without it, albeit some features may not be available.
Accessing or sharing your information
In order to provide products or services you’ve requested, we rely on some third-party subprocessors.
At your discretion, we may share your data if you integrate a third-party service into your use of our products. For instance, you might choose to connect your HubSpot account to your Copiloty by Nexforce account to access HubSpot information within Copiloty by Nexforce. Data transmitted through Copiloty by Nexforce to HubSpot will be stored by both Nexforce Global Corp and HubSpot.
Nexforce Global Corp employees may assume your Copiloty by Nexforce account to deliver system diagnostics or assistance to you. For example, if a bug arises that we identify and need to understand in your account, we will only access your account data with your explicit permission and to the extent necessary. We'll also inform you when this happens.
We reserve the right to disclose your data to law enforcement, regulatory bodies, or legal counsel in compliance with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, court order, legal process, or governmental request. In such circumstances, we will only share your data to the extent required and we will notify you unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.
Data Protection
The protection of your personal information is paramount to us. We take several measures to ensure your data is stored securely. This includes the use of encryption for data at rest and in transit, regular security audits and vulnerability scans, and training our staff in secure data handling practices.
We comply with the GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection regulations. You have rights to access, rectify, and erase your personal data, as well as restrict or object to processing, and to data portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
To exercise your rights, please contact us at product@nexforce.co. If you're unhappy with the way we've handled your data or your privacy rights, you may also lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country.
Data retention and deletion
We retain your personal data as long as your account remains active and as necessary to provide you with our services. After you close your account, we might still retain some of your information for legal, security, and business reasons, such as to comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, and fulfill our terms of service.
You can delete your account at any time by contacting support. Once your account is deleted, your data is removed from our active systems, although residual copies might remain in our backup systems for a short period. Please note that we cannot recover your data once your account is deleted.
Children's Privacy
Our services are not directed at persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes that affect your rights and freedoms, we'll notify you through our services or by email. By continuing to use our services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
